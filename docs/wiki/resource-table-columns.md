# Resource table columns

## BMAD story and evidence

As an administrator I need identifiable records and operational state without oversized technical columns. Acceptance: string-keyed `array<string, Column>`, fields backed by models and migrations (or Sushi schemas), sortable dates, optional technical details.

TemporaryUpload schema uses file_name, file_size, mime_type, status (not folder/filename). Media uses file_name, collection_name and bytes size. Conversion percentage is numerical. HasMediasTable has no concrete resource/model binding; retain only generic existing columns.

Sources: `app/Models`, `database/migrations`, existing resource `Pages/List*.php` and `Tables/*Table.php`. QMD query attempted before editing: unavailable because better-sqlite3 ABI 127 differs from Node ABI 147; direct source inspection used.
